# Drone-based Face Detection and Recognition for Real-time Analysis

The project aims to develop a face detection and recognition algorithm using a state-of-the-art model, namely Detectron2

-----------------

**Note:**

We have trained a face detection model using a baseline model trained with Detectron2 from Detectron2 Model Zoo. This model is required to execute our test code and real-time program, however it is not uploaded in this GitHub repository due to its large file size.

You are required to download the model from the Google Drive link attached below, unzip the output zip file and store it in the directory below for the code to execute successfully.
